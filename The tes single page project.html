			1.Microprocessor technology
			</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 20px;">
				👉 A microprocessor is a computer processor where the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit, or a small number of integrated circuits. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit. The integrated circuit is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations.[1] The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.

		 2.Vaccum Tube
		 </h3>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		  ️👉 A vacuum tube, also called a valve in British English, is an electronic device used in many older model radios, television sets, and amplifiers to control electric current flow. The cathode is heated, as in a light bulb, so it will emit electrons. This is called thermionic emission. The anode is the part that accepts the emitted electrons. The device may have other parts. Vacuum tubes must be hot to work. Most are made of glass, thus are fragile and can break. Vacuum tubes were used in the first computers like the ENIAC, which were large and need much work to continue operating.

        3.Evolution of Sensors
      </h4>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		  👉 Sensors technology is nothing new. In 1883, American professor Warren Johnson developed a technology that used an automatic sensor to indicate temperature, known as a bimetallic thermostat. From the early 1900s until the 1980s, we used canaries to sense the presence of carbon monoxide and other toxic gases in coal mines. And in the 1950s, the motion detector was first invented. All these involve sensors. 

Sensors detect and respond to a specified input. Input could be temperature, light, motion, pressure, sound or any number of things. On receiving said input, a sensor will either deliver a resulting output, a visual one perhaps, such as a light, or an audible one, such as an alarm; or the information received will be transmitted through a network for processing. 

Since the beginning of the IoT, sensor technology has taken a huge leap, with increased practical application in our everyday lives. Consider smart homes, with smart thermostats controlling the temperature or voice assistants respond to natural speech. This is thanks to the introduction of cloud connectivity, allowing the rapid transfer and processing of data, with access to oceans of information.

           4.ARM
      </h5>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		    👉 ARM (stylised in lowercase as arm, formerly an acronym for Advanced RISC Machines and originally Acorn RISC Machine) is a family of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction set architectures for computer processors, configured for various environments. Arm Ltd. develops the architectures and licenses them to other companies, who design their own products that implement one or more of those architectures, including system on a chip (SoC) and system on module (SOM) designs, that incorporate different components such as memory, interfaces, and radios. It also designs cores that implement these instruction set architectures and licenses these designs to many companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products.
